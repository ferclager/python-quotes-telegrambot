# Python Quotes Telegram Bot

This repository contains the code for building a Quote Telegram Bot using Python. The bot fetches quotes from the They Said So速 API and sends them to a specified Telegram chat.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

* **Telegram Bot**: Create a Telegram bot by following the instructions [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots).

* **Telegram Chat ID**: Obtain the chat ID from your bot. Refer to [this guide](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot) for more information. Also you can GET it from https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates, and see more recent chats.

* **Quotes API from They Said So速**: Sign up for the They Said So速 API to get access to the quotes. You can make 10 free calls per hour. Visit [here](https://theysaidso.com/api/) to get your API key.

* **Dependencies**: Check the `requirements.txt` file for the required libraries: [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/), [urllib](https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/), and [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/). Install these libraries before running the code.

* **Configuration**: Configure your environment by creating a `.env` file and adding the following environment variables:
```.env
	API_KEY_THEYSAIDSO=YOUR_API_KEY_FROM_THEYSAIDSO
	TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
	TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=YOUR_CHAT_ID
```

## Usage
To use the Quote Telegram Bot, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository:

```bash
	git clone git@github.com:ferclager/python-quotes-telegrambot.git
```

* Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
	cd python-quotes-telegrambot 
```

* Run the quotes.py script 
``` bash
	python3 quotes.py
```

If you have an issue like this one:
```bash
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	File "/Users/ferclager/Developer/python-quotes-telegrambot/quotes.py", line 2, in <module>
		import requests
	ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'
```

It means that you need to run this command first, to get all requirements from requirements.txt
```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: make sure that you have pip installed first.


That's it! The bot will fetch quotes from the They Said So速 API and send them to the specified Telegram chat.

Feel free to modify the code according to your requirements and enhance the functionality of the bot.
