All you will need to start is:
* Your telegram bot: [create one](https://core.telegram.org/bots).
* Your telegram chat ID from your bot: [check this out for more information](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot).
* Quotes API from They Said SoÂ®: [10 free calls/hr](https://theysaidso.com/api/).
