# Building a Quote Telegram Bot using Python

All you will need to start is:

* Your telegram bot: [create one](https://core.telegram.org/bots).

* Your telegram chat ID from your bot: [check this out for more information](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot).

* Quotes API from They Said SoÂ®: [10 free calls/hr](https://theysaidso.com/api/).

* Check requirements.txt, because you need for this code two libraries: [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/), [urllib](https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/), and [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) .
*  Configure your enviroment (file .env)
```
	API_KEY_THEYSAIDSO=YOUR_API_KEY_FROM_THEYSAIDSO
	TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
	TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=YOUR_CHAT_ID
```

* Use quotes.py with your own information.

  

And that's it!!!
